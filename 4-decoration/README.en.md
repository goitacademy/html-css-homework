**`«A1»`** In the root of the project, there is a folder called `images` with images.

**`«A2»`** All vector images (icons) are collected in the `icons.svg` SVG sprite in the `images` folder.

**`«A3»`** All vector images are optimized.

**`«A4»`** In the root of the project, there is a `css` folder with style sheets.

**`«A5»`** All styles are contained in one `styles.css` file in the `css` folder.

**`«A10»`** The code is in line with the [**guide**](https://codeguide.co/).

### Markup

**`«B1»`** Vector graphics in the `svg` format are used for all icons.

**`«B2»`** SVG icons are properly exported. When exporting, the "group" is selected, not the vector itself.

**`«C3»`** There is a permanent shadow effect in the cards of the `Our Team` section.

**`«C4»`** In the cards of the `Portfolio` page, there is a shadow effect when hovering over any part of the card.

**`«C6»`** When hovering or focusing with the keyboard, all icons should switch to an active state, i.e. change color, if specified in the layout.
