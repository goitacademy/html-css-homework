# Homework

- Create a repository `goit-markup-hw-03`.
- Clone the created repository and copy the previous work files into it.
- Add styles for geometry (width, margins, paddings and borders) and content positioning with Flexbox for page layout of [**homework #3**] (<https://www.figma.com/file/oTYBECAN79dXy19hzWObO4/Web-Studio-(Version-2.1)?node-id=1%3A94>).
- Set up `GitHub Pages` and add a link to the live page in the header of the GitHub repository.

## Criteria for work acceptance by the tutor

### Project

**`«A1»`** In the root of the project, there is a folder called `images` with images.

**`«A2»`** In the root of the project, there is a `css` folder with style sheets.

**`«A3»`** All styles are contained in one `styles.css` file in the `css` folder.

**`«A4»`** There are no capital letters, spaces and transliteration in the file names, only English letters and words.

**`«A5»`** Source code is formatted with `Prettier`.

**`«A6»`** All images and text content are taken from the layout.

**`«A7»`** All HTML pages have a style normalizer [`modern-nomalize`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize).

**`«A7»`** The code is in line with the [**guide**](https://codeguide.co/).

### Styling

**`«B1»`** Global style reset is allowed using tag selector for such elements as `<h1>...<h6>`, `<p>` and `<ul>`.

**`«B2»`** Elements have no margins (`margin` property) that "break through" the parent element.

**`«B3»`** In one-line element collections, the left or right `margin` (if any) is cleared for all elements.

**`«B4»`** The `margin` property is used for margins between two adjacent elements.

**`«B5»`** The `padding` property is used for the gap between the parent's edge and its child.

**`«B6»`** All margins (`margin` property) and paddings (`padding` property) of elements are set exactly in line with the layout.

**`«B7»`** There is a generic auxiliary class, `.container`, to center and restrict the width of content.

**`«B8»`** The width of the "container" matches the layout, and it is equal to `1200px`.

**`«B9»`** The "container" wraps header, footer and section content. That is, it is inside them.

**`«B10»`** `Flexbox` is used to arrange elements, but only where necessary. For example, in the header, navigation, lists in sections, etc., that is, where it is impossible to arrange elements horizontally in a different way.

**`«B11»`** Final box sizes in the browser match the layout.

**`«B12»`** Elements do not have a fixed height, as it is determined by their content.

**`«B13»`** The header has a bottom border, but you need to zoom in very closely to see it.

**`«B14»`** Section arrangement is similar to a stack of books, with no margins.

**`«B15»`** All sections use one class `.section`, and they are set top and bottom paddings at `94px`, pushing the content inside the section.

**`«B16»`** Grids are created using the technique described in the notes and video workshop.

**`«B17»`** The cards on the `Portfolio` page have a border (`border` property), but only at the bottom of the cards.
