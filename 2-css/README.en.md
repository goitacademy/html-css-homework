## Criteria for work acceptance by the tutor

### Project

**`«A1»`** In the root of the project, there is a folder called `images` with images.

**`«A2»`** In the root of the project, there is a `css` folder with style sheets.

**`«A3»`** All styles are contained in one `styles.css` file in the `css` folder.

**`«A4»`** There are no capital letters, spaces and transliteration in the file names, only English letters and words.

**`«A5»`** Source code is formatted with `Prettier`.

**`«A6»`** All images and text content are taken from the layout.

**`«A7»`** All raster images are optimized using [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/).

**`«A8»`** The code is in line with the [**guide**](https://codeguide.co/).

### Markup

**`«B1»`** The `Portfolio` page layout is in the `portfolio.html` file.

**`«B2»`** HTML-markup is done for all layout elements.

**`«B3»`** Tags are used according to their semantics.

**`«B4»`** HTML can be validated using [**validator**](http://validator.w3.org/nu/) without errors.

**`«B5»`** Class names are descriptive and can be understood by other developers.

**`«B6»`** Class names do not contain capital letters, spaces, transliteration and tag names, only English letters and words. If a class name consists of multiple words, they are separated by a hyphen.

**`«B7»`** The `href` attribute of the `Studio` and `Portfolio` navigation links contains a relative path to the HTML files of these pages. When you click on a link, you go to the corresponding page in the current browser tab.

**`«B8»`** All `<img>` tags have size attributes, at least `width`.

**`«B9»`** Images are exported from the layout in `jpg` format.

**`«B10»`** Groups of the same-type elements are in `<ul>` lists.

**`«B11»`** The filter on the `Portfolio` page is a list of buttons, each of which is set the `type="button"` attribute.

**`«B12»`** Header and footer markup is the same across all pages.

**`«B13»`** All fonts and their variations (weight and type) required for the layout are linked from the Google Fonts service with one link. The required weight for `Raleway` is 700, and for `Roboto`, it is 400, 500, 700 and 900.

**`«B14»`** There are no additional elements, such as spans or links, inside the button markup.

## Styling

**`«C1»`** There are no global element styles except for `<body>`.

**`«C2»`** Class selectors are used for styling.

**`«C3»`** Styles have no `!Important`.

**`«C4»`** Interactive elements (buttons and links), when hovering over or focusing with the keyboard, have an active state specified in the layout (color change).

**`«С5»`** The text of contacts in the header and footer changes color when hovering over or focusing with the keyboard.

**`«C6»`** CSS variables are used to store the palette of layout colors (text, background, highlighting).

**`«С7»`** The `<body>` element has the `font-family` property with the `Roboto` font dominating the layout.

**`«C8»`** There are alternative font variations and family type (sans serif) at the end of `font-family` for the `<body>` element.

**`«C9»`** The `Roboto` font family is explicitly set only for the `<body>` element, while the rest of the elements inherit it.

**`«С10»`** For the `<body>` element, the `color` property is set to the text color dominating the layout. The rest of the text inherits or overrides this value.

**`«С11»`** The font size (`font-size` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values from the layout.

**`«C12»`** The line height (`line-height` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values from the layout, and it is set as a multiplier, not in `px`.

**`«С13»`** The color (`color` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values from the layout.

**`«С14»`** The font weight (`font-weight` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values from the layout.

**`«С15»`** The font weight (`font-weight` property) is explicitly specified only if the value in the layout differs from the standard for this element in the browser.

**`«С16»`** All buttons are set the `cursor` property with the `pointer` value.

**`«С17»`** Styles do not repeat property values that are set by the browser by default. For example, links do not need to have `cursor: pointer`, and paragraphs do not require `font-style: normal` or `font-weight: 400`.
