## Criteria for work acceptance by the tutor

### Project

**`«A1»`** The `BEM` methodology is used.

**`«A2»`** The `SASS` preprocessor is used.

**`«A3»`** In the `index.html` and `portfolio.html` files, a minified style sheet, `main.min.css` from the `css` folder, is linked.

**`«A4»`** When viewing the page on any device with a width from `320px`, no horizontal scroll bar appears.

**`«A5»`** The mobile menu script is linked in HTML as a separate file, `mobile-menu.js`.

## Markup

**`«B1»`** All pages in the `<head>` box have the `viewport` meta tag.

**`«B2»`** All background and content raster images are responsive and support `x1` and `x2` pixel density.

**`«B3»`** Responsive content images use the `<img>` element with the `srcset` attribute and `x` descriptor.

**`«B4»`** Responsive background images use such media features as `min-device-pixel-ratio` and `min-resolution`.

**`«B5»`** The mobile menu layout is done.

## Styling

**`«C1»`** For writing styles, the `Mobile First` approach and `(min-width: )` media feature are used.

**`«C4»`** Layout is made relative to three transition points: 480px, 768px and 1200px.
